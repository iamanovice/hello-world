# hello-world
Subject: My first repository at github

Hi professionals and amateurs!
I am new to coding. I like to learn coding and make it useful. I have mainly dealing with "Hardwares" in the past, and now I take a new journal with "sofewares"!
I hope to be good at it and I appreciate any help from anybody.
